# 🚀 Absolutely Awesome React Components & Libraries

This is a list of AWESOME components. Nope, it's NOT a comprehensive list of
every React component under the sun. So, what does "awesome" mean? Well:

- It solves a real problem
- It does so in a 🦄 unique, 🦋 beautiful, or 🏆 exceptional way
- It has recent code commits!

Look for a 🚀 for truly amazing projects. And look for quickie maintainer
commentary and reviews in _(italic parens)_ after some listings of note.

Let me know how we can improve this list!
