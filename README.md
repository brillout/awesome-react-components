# üöÄ Absolutely Awesome React Components & Libraries

This is a list of AWESOME components. Nope, it's NOT a comprehensive list of
every React component under the sun. So, what does "awesome" mean? Well:

- It solves a real problem
- It does so in a ü¶Ñ unique, ü¶ã beautiful, or üèÜ exceptional way
- It has recent code commits!

Look for a üöÄ for truly amazing projects. And look for quickie maintainer
commentary and reviews in _(italic parens)_ after some listings of note.

Maintainers:

- [@petebray](https://github.com/bluepeter), author of [Fluxguard](https://fluxguard.com) &mdash; monitor PROD website changes.
